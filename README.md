This is for my working files in PICAXE's variant of BASIC

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/PICAXE.git`

This repo was originally public, then private (to prevent people passing my work off as their own and failing the standard), and now it's public again. I sign most (if not all) of my commits via GitHub's basic text editor, GitHub Codespaces (passing GPG availability to the codespace instance), and the devices I work on. This gives various assurances which prove that this is my own work, and not plagarised work.
